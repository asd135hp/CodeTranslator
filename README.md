# CodeTranslator
## Purpose
This ambitious project aims to deliver the code to be readable by everyone in the world.
## Background
English is not my mother tounge so I find it hard grasping the intention of the code as a child.
The mandatory coding books that we learnt in our school was honestly not in a good quality as they expected us
to understand the connection between English keywords and the translated ones. I would remember many of my classmates
were not keen on the subject due to either not caring or not understand anything about the concept of coding.
Therefore, why not at least make the experience in coding somewhat enjoyable to anyone that does not know much
about English?
## Aim
Have you heard about interpreted language? I hope that this project could go as far as being a generic compiler
that could interpret any kind of languages, even in a different languages other than English.
<br/>
However, the closest aim right now is to make this software as a medium for everyone to understand the "beauty"
of coding. This might involve with creating restructuring rules within translation JSON files.
## Installation
Have not done the software yet so could not show the steps for installation. But the project is written
purely in C# .NET Core, which will be available to all kinds of systems.
## Roadmap
- Define how the translator is shaped: <b>Done</b>
- Purge spaghetti code: <i>In progress...</i>
- Repurpose class objects to make reading more viable: <i>In progress...</i>
- Create WPF application from the main DLL: Planned
- Implement ruleset for translation: Not done
- Implement UML translation: Not done - Low priority
